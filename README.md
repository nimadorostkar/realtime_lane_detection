## Overview
Lane detection is one of the most crucial technique of ADAS and has received significant attention recently. In this project, we achived lane detection with real time by numpy and multi-thread.

## Dependencies
* Python
* Numpy
* Opencv

## How to Run
Run `lane_detection.py`. The default video is project_video, if you want to process the "fog_video.mp4", change video_index to 1 in line 9.
